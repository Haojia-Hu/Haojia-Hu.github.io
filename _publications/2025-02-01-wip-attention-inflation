excerpt: "This paper introduces the concept of the Household Attention Cycle to examine how consumer attention varies across goods and influences inflation expectations. Using Google Trends data, we construct a category-level attention index and identify systematic differences in attention dynamics.We show that attention amplifies the effect of price changes on inflation expectations, especially in categories with short, stable cycles. These findings highlight the behavioral and informational role of attention in expectationformation and price signal processing."

This paper introduces the concept of the Household Attention Cycle to examine how consumer attention varies across goods and influences inflation expectations. Using Google Trends data, we construct a category-level attention index and identify systematic differences in attention dynamics.We show that attention amplifies the effect of price changes on inflation expectations, especially in categories with short, stable cycles. These findings highlight the behavioral and informational role of attention in expectationformation and price signal processing.
